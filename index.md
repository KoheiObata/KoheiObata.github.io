#### Research Agenda
My research interests includes, data mining, time series analysis.


#### Short Biography
I am a Ph.D. candidate in the <a href="https://www.dm.sanken.osaka-u.ac.jp/">Sakurai & Matsubara Lab</a> at the Department of Information Science and Technology of the <a href="https://www.osaka-u.ac.jp/en/">Osaka University</a>
with an anticipated dissertation defense in March 2026.
My research focus is primarily time series data mining, and I have experience in developing both machine learning models and deep learning models.
I'm currently working on anomaly detection with a diffusion model.

I'm open for research internship roles from 2024 ~ 2025 Fall.
